## Design Choices
For my portfolio, I prioritized simplicity in the design. I chose brown as the base color because of its universal appeal and aesthetic quality. To add a subtle visual interest, I incorporated a gradient background. My goal was to keep the design clean and visually pleasing, following the principle that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
## Challenges and Resolutions
Throughout the project, I encountered several challenges. The first was deciding how to structure and design the overall layout. To overcome this, I searched online for inspiration and best practices.

The most difficult challenge I faced was embedding various projects, as they were built using different programming languages. I struggled to find an efficient way to include them and spent considerable time researching potential solutions. Despite spending a lot of time researching various methods, I was only able to successfully embed my Canva project and a form we worked on last time.

Another challenge was aligning text and other items on the page, especially in the contact section. Despite trying multiple CSS techniques such as flex, align-items, and justify-content, I couldn't achieve the exact alignment I wanted.

Throughout the project, I often turned to online resources for solutions. Although there were moments of burnout when I felt unsure of how to proceed, I’m pleased with the outcome of my portfolio. However, I acknowledge there’s still room for improvement and growth.
